        </h2>

        <p>
            Our goal is to understand how economics is ruling every aspects of our lives. How people make decisions when doing their groceries?! 
            What is their reaction when price changes? What if the price of banana increases 10X? Would you still consume banana? 
            What if the price of a vital medicine increases 10X? Would you still buy it? 
        </p>

        <p>
            How about the firms and companies?! What does determine their behavior? How firms react to market and how they respond to their competitors decisions?
        </p>

        <p>
            What about governments? Is it justifiable for them to intervene in market? Can we trust them? 
        </p>

        <p id="main-question">
            Is it possible that self-interest seeking entities maximize the welfare of their society?

        <h2 id="grading-policy">Grading Policy</h2>

        <h3>1-	Exams (25% + 25%)</h3>
            
        <p>
            Exams count toward 50% of the final grade. There will be one midterm exam and one final exam with equal weights. Final exam is not cumulative but notice that you need a good understanding of the first part to answer questions in final exam. 
        </p>

        <div class='warning'>
            <p>
                <i class="material-icons">error</i>
                <strong>Important:</strong>
                There is no makeup exam.
                If you have a conflict with the exam schedule, please let the instructor know in advance. If you miss an exam, you should provide sufficient paperwork for your excuse. A make-up exam is not guaranteed.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            Please note that these exam dates are tentative depending on the progress of the course. Actual test dates will be announced in class. The final exam date and time are nonnegotiable.
            Phones should be in silent mode and not visible during test time.
            Your ID is required on exam date.
        </p> 
            
        <h3>2-	Homework Sets (40% + 5%)</h3>

        <p>
            Homework section accounts for 45% of the final grade. This section has the highest weight in your final grade as it is the most important section of the course. 
            Indeed, this course is heavily based on homework sets and you are required to put aside a significant part of your study time for answering the homework sets.
        </p>
        <p>
            There will be 12 homework sets and each set might include different subsets assigned in different times. 
            We will have at least one homework set assigned per week but in some weeks through the course you might be required to submit more than one homework set.
        </p>
        <p>
            I will assign the homework sets through MyEconLab (MyEconLab is required for this course). 
            The assignment of these homework sets is based on the pace of the lectures and hence the due dates are not consistent. 
            It is your responsibility to check out for the due dates on MyEconLab and make sure that you will not miss the dates.
        </p>
        
        <div class='warning'> 
            <p> 
                <i class="material-icons">error</i>
                <strong>Important:</strong>
                I do not accept late submission and you will get a zero for late submitted homeworks. 
                If for any reason you cannot submit your homework on time then please send me an email as soon as possible explaining your condition. 
                I will extend the due date in specific conditions but this extension is solely based on the instructor’s discretion.
            </P> 
        </div>
        
        <p>
            Only 10 homework sets with highest grades out of these 12 sets will be counted toward your final grade (They constitute 40% of your final grade). 
            5% of your final grade is reserved for submission of your work for ALL homework sets 
            (Your work should also reflect an evident effort which is determined by instructor’s discretion), otherwise you will not get this portion.
        </p>

        <p>
            Homework tasks will be assigned under MyEconLab platform. 
            Information on options of how you can purchase your textbook package for this course can be viewed at Pearson store. 
            The bookstore will carry the student value edition plus MyEconLab access card package, at a lower price than the textbook edition.            
        </p>

        <h3>3-	Attendance (5%)</h3>
            
        <p>
            5 points are allocated for class attendance. Your grade for this section follows a binary scheme: If you attend 85% percent of the classes then you will 
            get five points otherwise you will get zero for this section.
        </p>
         
        <p>
            I also expect you to not distract instructor and your classmates. Some examples of distracting behaviors are working with cell-phone and chatting with your friends in the class. 

        </p>

        <div class='warning'> 
            <p> 
                <i class="material-icons">error</i>
                <strong>Important:</strong>
                Distracting behavior has a negative impact on your grade (up to 10 penalty points) upon the discretion of instructor.
            </P> 
        </div>

        <p>I use the FIU Check-In program to take the attendance.
        FIU Check-In captures classroom attendance by having students "check in" using their smartphone to scan a QR code placed inside the classroom. 
        Here are what the QR codes look like:</p>

        <img src="../images/QR-code.png" alt="FIU Check-In QR Code">

        <p>
            Steps for Students to check-in:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Download the FIU Check-In app and sign in with your FIU credentials.</li>
            <li>Scan the QR code in class via the app. Students can start checking in 9 minutes before class is scheduled.</li>
            <li>A confirmation message will appear upon successful check-in.  </li>          
        </ol> 

        <P>Note: Students may receive a “No Event Found” message if they check-in before the 9 minutes mark or if they recently enrolled in the class. 
                If a student enrolled in class the same day, they will be able to check-in within 24 hours.
        </P>
            
        <h3>4-	Bonus points (5pts + 5pts + 5pts)</h3>
            
        <p>
            You can benefit up to 15 bonus points by putting efforts in three different bonus sections:
        </p>
            
        <h4>4-1- Kahoot Quizzes (5pts)</h4>
        
        <p>
            We will have random quizzes by using <a href="https://kahoot.it/">kahoot.it</a>, so please make sure that you will bring your cell-phone, tablet, or your laptop. You can either log in through your browser or the app and you have to use your Panther ID as your username.
            These quizzes are not mandatory and they are a part of bonus points. They are designed to help students to improve their performance.
        </p>
            
        <p>
            Your final grade for Kahoot section depends on your Kahoot rank (your performance among other students). The better the Kahoot rank the higher the bonus points. This is the scheme:
        </p>


        <table id="kahoot">
            <tr>
                <td class=col1>Ranked among top 5%</td>

                <td>3.5 bonus points</td>
            </tr>

        </table>
            
        <h4>4-2- Group Work (5pts)</h4>
            
        <p>
            Instructor will form different groups of students based on the class size.
            Each team will have a team leader appointed by instructor.
        </p> 
            
        <p>Students of each group are required to:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Review the lecture notes in group sessions after the class. </li>
            <li>Answer to the questions of your teammates and help each other with lecture notes.</li>
            <li>Review and answer the practice sets that will be assigned through the semester (Collectively, i.e. you are allowed to work together, but submit your answer in your own words).</li>
            <li>Submit random team work quizzes that might be assigned through the semester (Collectively, i.e. you are allowed to work together, but submit your answer in your own words).</li>
        </ul>
            
        <p>It is the responsibility of team leader to:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Arrange at least one meeting per week.</li>
            <li>
                Send me the schedule of your meetings including time and location. 
                (Adequately before the meetings)

            </li>
            <li>
                Send me a short weekly report explaining: (a) What you have done, (b) Who has participated
            </li>
        </ul>
            
 
        <p> 

                Students are responsible for these group sessions and the instructor will not intervene about the meeting location, time, 
                group responsibilities, or other related issues. However, whenever you have encountered any type of problems regarding the group work 
                meetings, then you have to contact me as soon as possible to explain your concerns.
        </P> 


        <p>
        The instructor will weekly evaluate your efforts based on (a) the reports received from team leaders and 
        (b) your answers to the practice tests and team work quizzes. 
        Your final grade for team work tasks will be equal to the average points of all members of your group. 
        So for this section, your grade depends not only on your own performance but also on the performance of your teammates.
        </p>

        <p>
        This team work section has up to 5 bonus points. However, it is not mandatory and you can opt out of this section either at the beginning of 
        the semester or right after the midterm exam. But if you sign in for this section, then it is mandatory to attend the group meetings. 
        </p>

        <div class='warning'>

                <strong>Important:</strong>
                You may receive up to 3 penalty points for signing in this section but not showing up in group meetings. 
                (And of course, you will not receive any bonus points from this section)
            </P> 
        </div>

        <h4>4-3- Class Activities (5pts)</h4>
            
        <p>
            5 bonus points are allocated for challenging the instructor scientifically, engaging in an informative discussion, and also asking questions.
